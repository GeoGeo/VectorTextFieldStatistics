name=Vector Text Field Statistics
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=I wrote this plugin to help with "wide, sparse" tables, such as imports from OpenStreetMap and NaturalEarth. For a selected vector layer, it finds discrete values for each text field together with the number of features. This can be useful in assessing data quality, and for deciding how to set up styling rules.
